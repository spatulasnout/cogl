  • List of changes since Clutter 1.7.0

   » Add an example program to draw a 3D crate

   » Add experimental API to get and set the viewport on a framebuffer
     without going through the implicit context.

   » Add API to select the winsys backend without having to use an
     environment variable.

   » Various documentation fixes.

   » Add winsys-specific typesafe APIs to replace the old
     cogl_renderer_handle_native_event functions.

   » Rename platform-specific APIs so that we consistently have
     cogl_<platform>_symbol_name instead of cogl_symbol_name_<platform>.

   » Fixed building against GLES.

      » Supported EGL platforms include: NULL, X11, GDL and Wayland

    » Adds renderer,display,onscreen-template and swap-chain APIs for
      writing standalone apps using the experimental 2.0 API

    » Added convenience functions cogl_matrix_view_2d_in_frustum/perspective
      for setting up a Clutter style view transform for a 2d coordinate system
      inside a projective perspective.

    » Added an experimental Quaternion API

    » Added an experimental Euler API

    » Re-worked the CoglPipeline depth testing state API

    » Added EGL X11 texture-from-pixmap support.

    » Added a tiny Wayland compositor (without input support) under
